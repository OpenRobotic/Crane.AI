# Crane.AI
Build a motorized **Truck bed Crane** controlled by A.I. and able to load and unload Heavy &amp; Large items autonomously!

# Degrees of Freedom:
- Rotate Base
- Extend / Retract Beam ¨Arm¨ (linear actuator with Lock mechanism)
- Change Beam Angle (Hydraulic) - Increases or Lowers the Highest point, without extending the Am.
- Raise Lower Tool (Winch)
- Activate Tool (Gripper, Electromagnet, Locking Permanent Magnet, Clamps, Barrel Crane tool, Hook)
- Torsion (Twist) Cable - this can help correct Misalignments when lowering! Will require a unique mechanism
